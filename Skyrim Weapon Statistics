#Below is a project I worked on using Skyrim Weapon data I downloaded from Kaggle (Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elmartini/skyrim-weapons-dataset). 
Skyrim is a popular role-playing game set in a fantasy world filled with dragons and magic. 

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.SkyrimData (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
Name VARCHAR NOT NULL UNIQUE,
Damage INTEGER,
Weight INTEGER,
Gold INTEGER,
Upgrade TEXT,
Perk TEXT,
Type TEXT,
Category TEXT,
Speed Integer);

SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.SkyrimData
LIMIT 5;

SELECT name, gold, category FROM BIT_DB.SkyrimData
GROUP BY name
ORDER BY Gold DESC
LIMIT 1;

SELECT Name, Damage, Category FROM BIT_DB.SkyrimData
GROUP BY name
ORDER BY damage DESC
LIMIT 1;

SELECT name, gold, category FROM BIT_DB.SkyrimData
GROUP BY name
ORDER BY Gold DESC
LIMIT 10;

SELECT Name, Damage, Category FROM BIT_DB.SkyrimData
GROUP BY name
ORDER BY damage DESC
LIMIT 10;

SELECT Name, Damage, Category FROM BIT_DB.SkyrimData
WHERE category <> 'Two-Handed'
GROUP BY name
ORDER BY damage DESC
LIMIT 10;

SELECT Name, Gold, Category, Type FROM BIT_DB.SkyrimData
WHERE category <> 'Two-Handed'
GROUP BY name
ORDER BY gold DESC
LIMIT 10;

SELECT Upgrade, SUM(Gold), COUNT(name) FROM BIT_DB.SkyrimData
GROUP BY Upgrade HAVING upgrade <> 'None required' AND upgrade <> 'N/A' AND upgrade <> ''
ORDER BY SUM(Gold) DESC
LIMIT 5;
