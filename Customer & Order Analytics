#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT acctnum FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON Feb.orderID = cust.order_id;

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT DISTINCT product, MIN(price) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER by price asc LIMIT 1;
#OR
SELECT DISTINCT product, price 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
ORDER BY price asc
LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(quantity)*price as Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, sum(quantity) as total_sold, SUM(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT count(acctnum) FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales feb
ON feb.orderID = cust.order_id
WHERE feb.Quantity >2;
